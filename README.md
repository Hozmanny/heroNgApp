# Hero Ng App
This is a heroes CRUD, made by using Angular for the front-end, and also using a simple-fast-noCode backend made with [JSON server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server "JSON server").

#### Using Angular Material
I've been created this Angular Project, to learn more about some of the Angular's features, by using [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/ "Angular Material's") components for a proper visual experience.
